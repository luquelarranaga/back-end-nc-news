Hi there! Welcome to NC News:)

When you begin you will need to set up some .env files. Please follow the below steps:

1.  Create a file called .env.development. This will connect to your development database.
2.  Inside this file, add the following code on line 1: PGDATABASE = nc_news
3.  Create a second file called .env.test. This will connect to your test database.
4.  Inside this file, add the following code on line 1: PGDATABASE = nc_news_test

Enjoy!
